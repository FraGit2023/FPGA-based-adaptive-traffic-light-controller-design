The main purpose of this project work is the development of an adaptive Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based control system able to control a traffic light four-way junction.
The control system is based on seven HC-SR04 ultrasound sensors, one for each travel lane, able to monitoring the traffic density. Continuous monitoring of these sensors provides real time vehicle density to ensure 
proper signals generation.
The control system is implemented on a Terasic DE10-Lite FPGA, programmed using VHDL code on the software Quartus.
The proposed traffic light controller allows for reduced waiting times of vehicles, optimizing the average traffic flow, reducing traffic jams and consequently lowering theenvironmental pollution, thus making an 
important contribution in smart cities context.
